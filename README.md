Small Project to help you work with data, implement logical operations, handle files, write tests, and produce a well-documented and runnable script or program.

- Load the json containing scooters & users into memory.
- Scooters that are not assigned to a user and are decommissioned should be deleted.
- Scooters that are not assigned to a user and not decommissioned should be assigned to users without a scooter.

Additionally,  add tests for the functions that you implement. logically log the operations that it is performing and when all operations are done the final version of the data should be printed.
